- [ ] How to write integration tests?
  - for example to test malformed json body
- [ ] Do we need a new data type for every json request / response body? What is the preferred way for ad-hoc json?
  - yes for request parsing
  - for responses ad-hoc is okay, with (.=), pairs and encode
- [ ] What is the best way to specify package versions in package.yaml?
  - == 2.* gives you an upper bound
  - == 4.* is good for base
- [ ] Any thoughts on RIO?
  - there are several different base replacements, it's a mess
  - just use base, there is nothing wrong with it
  - make a file Imports.hs to re-export often-used stuff, then in every source file import Imports
- [ ] How to do exception handling in Database, the SQL functions can throw exceptions

  - Scotty.liftAndCatchIO?
- [ ] How to handle the error that withdraw tries to get more than available?

TODO

- no exceptions in transferMoney
- speed up tests
  - tests should use connection pool, see package resource pool
  - re-use one connection somehow
  - app should use connection pool
  - tests should initialize the pool to use one connection (pool size 1)
    - gives synchronization automatically
