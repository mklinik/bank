# Banking API

## Summary

Create an HTTP API for managing banking accounts. Your API will have six features, each with its own endpoint. Additionally, there are some global requirements.

Deliver a link to a repository containing your project (e.g. GitHub). To get an impression of your way of working we want to be able to see your commit history.
## Global requirements
- The API and its tests should be written in Clojure.
- Automated tests prove each feature/requirement is correctly implemented.
- Make use of a database such that domain information (accounts etc.) is not lost on a system restart.
- The API is able to asynchronously process 1000 concurrent requests.
- Request and response bodies are in JSON format.

### API

Endpoint:

Assuming the following sequence of transactions:

- deposit $100 to account #1
- transfer $5 from account #1 to account #900

- withdraw $20 from account #1

The endpoint responds with this body:

    [
        {
            "sequence": 3,
            "debit": 20,
            "description": "withdraw"

        {
            "sequence": 2,

            "description": "receive from #800"
        },
        {
            "sequence": 1,
            "debit": 5,
            "description": "send to #900"
        },
        {
